            <div>Tiny Fractals is a tool I (Dave; Hi!) wrote because I noticed a lot of people on sites like Reddit <em>wanting</em> to teach, and a lot of others wanting to <em>be</em> taught, but not a lot of cross-contact!<br>Tiny Fractals allows you to find people that either can teach you, or that you can teach!</div>

            <div class="is-size-4" id="basic-usage">Basic Usage:</div>
            <div>I’ve tried to make usage of this app as simple as possible. Assuming you’ve logged in (i.e., you can see this page!), your first stop is gonna be the <strong>Profile</strong> page.</div>
            <div class="notification has-background-white is-fullwidth content">
                <div class='is-size-5'>Profile:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add skills you wanna learn by clicking the <div class='tag is-info is-size-6'><i class="fa fa-plus"></i>&nbsp;Add Skill</div> button. <ul>
                            <li>You can also add completely new skills if the one you want isn’t listed!</li>
                            <li>For each skill, you’ll be asked to give it a (somewhat subjective!) rating from 1-10. Be honest with yourself!</li>
                            <li>Feel like you can teach a particular skill? Go ahead and click that “Can Teach” checkbox!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Change any other profile info you want.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>Now that we’ve told the world who we are, we wanna move onto meeting other people! Let’s head over to the <strong><em>Match</em></strong> page.</div>
            <div class="notification has-background-white is-fullwidth content">
                <div class='is-size-5'>Match:</div>
                <div>This is the crux of the app. Here, you can connect with mentors/students, search by skill, etc., and generally make those awesome educational connections. How you use this depends on whether you’re a mentor or a student:</div>
                <div class='is-italic has-font-weight-bold'><i class="fa fa-arrow-right has-font-weight-bold"></i>&nbsp;I wanna learn!</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start by picking some skills you wanna learn. </li>
                    <li>If you just wanna improve on a skill (and not start from scratch), you can optionally add <code>min level</code>.</li>
                    <li>Only teachers who have that skill, have clicked their own “Can Teach” box, and are at (or above) your min level will be included.</li>
                    <li>Once you've found a match, click "Connect" to send them a connection mail (you'll get a copy in your inbox too).
                        <ul>
                            <li>Note that some users are marked as "Demo User".</li>
                            <li>These are fake users that exist purely to show you what the app looks like.</li>
                            <li>They're auto-generated, with Math! And Science!</li>
                            <li>They don't actually <em>exist</em>, so they're not available for teaching (they wouldn't be very good at it!).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div>Can’t find any teachers that wanna teach your given skills? Go ahead and smack that <div class='tag is-info is-size-6'><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>&nbsp;Request Lesson</div> button, and we’ll put a message out into the Aether that you’re lookin for some help!</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can view your lesson request on the <code>View Requested Lessons</code> tab at any time up until you’ve connected with a teacher.</li>
                    <li>You can also delete this lesson request if you don’t need it anymore!</li>
                    <li>Each teacher that offers to teach this lesson will have an <div class="tag is-info"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>&nbsp;Accept</div> button next to their name. Clicking this will <em>delete</em> the lesson request, and send a message to both Mentor and Student that it’s time to connect!</li>
                </ul>

                    <div class='is-italic has-font-weight-bold is-fullwidth'><i class="fa fa-arrow-right has-font-weight-bold"></i>&nbsp;I wanna teach!</div><br> Cool! If you wanna teach, there are two ways to get started. The first is to simply create a profile with some cool skills and remember to click that “Can Teach” box.<br> The second is to head on over to that <code>View Requested Lessons</code> tab. Here’s where you’ll see all the lessons that other users have requested (duh).
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you feel like you can teach a lesson, click that <div class='tag is-info is-size-6'>Teach It!</div> button.</li>
                    <li>Don’t feel like you wanna teach that lesson anymore? We understand. Just click that <div class='tag is-info is-size-6'><i class="fa fa-times">&nbsp;</i>Cancel Teaching Offer</div> button. Note that this does <em>not</em> apply to lessons in progress (i.e., you must click this button before the student accepts your offer).</li>

            <div>Here’s some tips for general use.</div>
            <div class="content">

                <ul>
                    <li>Be <em>honest</em> about your skills! Remember this app is for people to learn, so if you say you’re a level 9/10 in Elvish, and you’re realistically only a level 2, it’s only gonna confuse people.</li>
                    <li>Be nice! Remember, everyone does better when we treat our students <em>and</em> teachers with respect and friendliness!</li>
                    <li>The more info you can provide, the better. Studies show that sticking a nice, friendly picture on your profile to help make yourself seem more approachable is highly recommended by Dave.</li>
                    <li>Try to include some projects too. They don’t need to be the next FaceBook, but the more people can see how you work, the better!</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="is-size-4" id="credits">Credits:</div>

                This app was dreamt up, written, broken, thrown out, and re-written by me, <a href="https://www.github.com/newms34" target='_blank'>David Newman</a>.<br/>
                I’m not making any money off of this, nor do I plan to. If someone else <em>is</em>, then that’s really uncool. Let them know how uncool they’re being, please.
            </ul>

            <div>The code for this app lives at <a href="https://github.com/Newms34/tinyfracs"  target='_blank'>this github repo</a>. If you’ve got any cool features you can add, feel free to submit a pull request (preferably with code!).</div>
